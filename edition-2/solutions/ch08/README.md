Build the CLI in this module:

    go build -o ensemble-cli .

Set `LLM_VENDOR` (`anthropic`, `openai`, or `gemini`), `LLM_MODEL`, and
`LLM_API_KEY`, then run `ensemble-cli chat` from your chosen workspace. Model
names are explicit; select one available to your provider account. Messages
while the agent is busy are hints; `/interrupt` ends the current turn while
other jobs continue. EOF waits for the current turn and shuts down the Agent.

Known models stream by default. `EN_DISABLE_STREAMING=1` requests one-piece
responses. Unknown models remain usable for text with streaming off. Replies
go to stdout; reasoning and tool arguments go to stderr. Redirected streams
contain no ANSI formatting. The CLI writes wire frames to `api.log` and facts
to `ch02.jsonl` (override the latter with `CH07_AGENT_LOG`). Authentication
headers are excluded and the configured key is redacted from wire traces.

The no-argument CLI accepts the existing JSON-lines exercise protocol. The
separate [Chapter 7 application](ch07/README.md) demonstrates the public library
and reports delta counts, finalized parts and time to first delta.

Chapter 8's optional browser application lives in the separate `gui/` module;
see `gui/README.md`. The existing headless command remains independent of HTTP,
WebSocket and browser dependencies. Both applications use the same public Agent
API; the GUI executable also accepts terminal input for its existing Agent.
